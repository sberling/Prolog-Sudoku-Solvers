# Prolog-Sudoku-Solvers
A prolog program to solve normal sudokus as well as a prolog program to solve sky sudokus, both by generate-and-check. Sky sudokus are normal sudokus that also have hints adjacent to the grid that indicates how many cells in that row/column are visible. A cell is visible if all the cells between itself and the hint have numbers of lesser value.
